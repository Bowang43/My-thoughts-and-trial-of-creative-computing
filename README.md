# My trial and thoughts about creative computing😀

B0's first repository about creative computing

Hello,this is bo☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️

🦋**My learning log**🦋

On monday's In-studio learning, I learned the basics of creative computing, its uses, advantages and disadvantages. By looking at the tutorial videos, we used the Arduino kit to wire up an LED. That’s the try for the physical computing.

I personally have a keen interest in media art and I see creative computing as a tool and a platform for presentation in media art. Many of the cool motion graphics nowadays are drawn through code tools like p5sj and the Fourier Transforms we talked about in last week's lecture, which are written in code to control the direction of the trajectory of the image and determine the visual effects of a motion graphic.
My little attempt to use Fourier Transforms.

Also, i tried for making filters in Spark Ar before. I thought filter making tools is a kind of creative computing. I simply tried to go for a flowing effect and it can change with the angle of your face. Also i did some facial adjustments such as adding a higher nose, bigger eyes, and a slimmer face. If I had more time I would try to add some facial stickers or makeup.

**What tools can be used for creative computing in visual arts?**

*There are thousands kind of computing coding languages in the world*

Python

JAVA

C

C++

PHP

...

*Also many platforms for visual designers to build creative computing communities*

P5.js

Stack Overflow

Digi-Gxl

From the tools i listed above, i found that p5js can really acheive many visual media effects and create interactive artworks.

**P5js in graphic communication**

Interactive Visual

Dynamic Web

Emotional Design×Hardware Programming

Dynamic capture×Installation art

Machine Learning×Image Recognition

Data visualization

Poems

**Reaserch Media Artitst-KunHao Lin and his text generation poems**

I have a favorite new media artist, KunHao Lin, who uses creative computing to do some beautiful new media work.I found his genetic text generation project really interesting because it made me realise how beautiful and intriguing text poetry generated by artificial intelligence can be. Sometimes, things that are too logical tend to lack beauty and people don't stop to think about their meaning. Computer-generated jumbled verses like this one make people stop to read and appreciate them. And each person will have their own Chinese verse, which is very much a personal touch and a strong interaction with people. 

Here are some examples of KunHao’s poem written by automatic majibake. You can generate your own Chinese poems in www.dabeiyuzhou.com

**Virtual Butterflies by KunHao Lin**

Also there is a virtual butterfly project. He uses data as well as neural network algorithms to synthesize insects, like a kind of human-machine collaborative creation. The synthetic butterfly patterns obtained by the algorithm are all different and each one is unique. He has now generated over 600,000 butterflies. I think it is a very successful digital art derivative.
